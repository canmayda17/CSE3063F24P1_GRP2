***IMPORTANT***

You have to make sure that your IDE supports gson library in order for JSON file creation to work.
If you don't use Maven, go to this link: https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.google.code.gson
Download the jar file with the Artifact ID as "json"
After downloading, you have to add it to the classpath of your project. Google your IDE name with "how to add jar file to classpath"
