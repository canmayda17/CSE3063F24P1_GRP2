***IMPORTANT***

You have to make sure that your IDE supports gson library in order for JSON file creation to work.
If you don't use Maven, download the jar file in the repo.
After downloading, you have to add it to the classpath of your project. Google your IDE name with "how to add jar file to classpath"
